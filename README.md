# Numerical Methods in Matlab/Octave

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nmfsc/octave/HEAD)

This Jupyter Notebook serves as supplementary material to the Matlab/Octave code from the book Numerical Methods for Scientific Computing. Many of these code snippets are minimal working and toy algorithms meant to better understand the mathematics.
